## 6. Performance Bottlenecks

### Identified Bottlenecks

#### 1. Full Build Size (Priority: High)
- **Issue:** 26.54KB is large compared to minimal 2.84KB
- **Impact:** May discourage adoption for size-sensitive applications
- **Root Cause:** Comprehensive feature set without lazy loading

#### 2. Build Time (Priority: Medium)
- **Issue:** 1.4s clean build time
- **Impact:** Slower development iteration
- **Root Cause:** TypeScript compilation and bundling process

#### 3. Instance Creation Overhead (Priority: Low)
- **Issue:** Full instances take 8x longer to create than minimal
- **Impact:** Minor performance difference in high-frequency scenarios
- **Root Cause:** Additional feature initialization

### Performance Hotspots
1. **Bundle parsing:** Large full build requires more parsing time
2. **Feature initialization:** Full build initializes all features at startup
3. **TypeScript compilation:** Complex type system increases build time

---

## 7. Optimization Opportunities

### Immediate (Sprint 1)
1. **Plugin Architecture**
   - Split features into optional plugins
   - Implement dynamic imports for heavy features
   - **Expected Impact:** 40-60% size reduction for custom builds

2. **Dead Code Elimination**
   - Add /*#__PURE__*/ annotations
   - Optimize export structure
   - **Expected Impact:** 5-10% size reduction

### Short-term (Sprint 2-3)
3. **Build Optimization**
   - Implement incremental compilation
   - Add build caching
   - **Expected Impact:** 30-50% faster builds

4. **Lazy Loading**
   - Load adapters on-demand
   - Defer heavy feature initialization
   - **Expected Impact:** Faster startup, smaller initial bundles

### Long-term (Sprint 4+)
5. **Advanced Bundling**
   - Multiple entry points for features
   - Runtime feature detection
   - **Expected Impact:** Optimal bundle sizes for all use cases

6. **Memory Optimization**
   - Object pooling for frequent operations
   - Weak references for cached objects
   - **Expected Impact:** Reduced memory pressure
