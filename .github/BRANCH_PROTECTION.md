      - "CI Pipeline"
      - "Security Scan"
    max_auto_merge_delay: "1h"
    conditions:
      - author: "dependabot[bot]"
      - check: "security_vulnerabilities == 0"
```

### Required Environments

## Implementation Checklist

To implement these settings:

1. **Navigate to Repository Settings**
   - Go to repository Settings → Branches

2. **Add Branch Protection Rule for `main`**
   - Click "Add rule"
   - Configure all settings listed above

3. **Configure Security Settings**
   - Go to Settings → Security & analysis
   - Enable all recommended security features

4. **Set up Required Status Checks**
   - Ensure all CI workflows are running
   - Add each workflow job as a required status check

5. **Configure CODEOWNERS**
   - Ensure the CODEOWNERS file is properly set up
   - Test that code owners are automatically requested for reviews

6. **Test the Configuration**
   - Create a test PR to verify all rules are working
   - Ensure status checks are required and functioning

## Emergency Procedures

### Hotfix Process
For critical security or production issues:

1. Create hotfix branch from `main`
2. Implement minimal fix with thorough testing
3. Create PR with "hotfix" label
4. Require security team review for security issues
5. Fast-track through CI pipeline with all checks
6. Deploy with post-deployment monitoring

### Bypass Procedures
If branch protection bypass is needed:
1. Document the reason for bypass
2. Get approval from two repository administrators
3. Create issue documenting the bypass reason
4. Restore normal protections immediately after

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Reviews
- Monthly review of protection rules effectiveness
- Quarterly security settings audit
- Annual review of bypass permissions

### Metrics to Track
- Pull request review coverage
- Time to merge for different PR types
- Security scan failure rates
- CI pipeline success rates

**Note**: These settings should be implemented gradually and tested thoroughly. Start with less restrictive settings and tighten them as the team adapts to the new workflow.
