# Security Policy

## ⚠️ Alpha Software Security Notice

**IMPORTANT**: @fluxhttp/core is currently in alpha development and should **NOT** be used in production environments.

### Current Security Status

This project is in early development and has not undergone comprehensive security testing or audit. Many security features are still under development or incomplete.

### Security Features Status

**Recently Implemented (Partial)**:
- ✅ **URL Validation**: Basic protection against javascript:, data:, and SSRF attacks
- ✅ **Input Sanitization**: XSS and NoSQL injection detection in request data
- ✅ **Error Sanitization**: Sensitive information removal from error messages
- ✅ **Cryptographic Improvements**: Enhanced token encryption with AES-GCM
- ✅ **Header Validation**: HTTP header injection prevention
- ✅ **Prototype Pollution Protection**: Basic object validation

**Partially Implemented**:
- ⚠️ **CSRF Protection**: Token-based protection (implementation incomplete)
- ⚠️ **Rate Limiting**: Basic rate limiting (easily bypassed)
- ⚠️ **Content Validation**: Size and type validation (needs enhancement)
- ⚠️ **Security Headers**: Framework exists but not automatically applied

**Still Vulnerable**:
- ❌ **Path Traversal**: Limited protection against directory traversal
- ❌ **Command Injection**: Partial header validation only
- ❌ **Content Type Bypass**: MIME validation can be circumvented

### Known Security Limitations

1. **Critical Vulnerabilities Remain**: Despite recent fixes, several high-risk vulnerabilities persist
2. **SSRF Protection Incomplete**: Private IP validation may have bypasses
3. **Rate Limiting Ineffective**: Current implementation can be easily circumvented
4. **CSRF Tokens Weak**: Token generation and validation needs strengthening
5. **Content Validation Gaps**: File upload and MIME type validation incomplete
6. **Build Dependencies**: Development dependencies have not been security audited
7. **No Security Testing**: Automated security testing not integrated in CI/CD

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in this alpha software, please report it responsibly:

### For Alpha Stage Issues

- **Email**: security@fluxhttp.com (if available) or create a GitHub issue
- **Response Time**: Best effort during development
- **Public Disclosure**: Issues may be discussed publicly due to alpha status

### Information to Include

When reporting a security issue, please include:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed reproduction steps
3. **Impact Assessment**: Potential impact and affected components
4. **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for a fix

## Security Best Practices for Alpha Users

If you choose to experiment with this alpha software:

1. **Never use in production**: This software is not production-ready
2. **Isolated Testing**: Use only in isolated development environments
3. **No Sensitive Data**: Avoid using with real sensitive data
4. **Network Security**: Use additional network security measures
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies and environment updated

## Planned Security Roadmap

### Version 0.2.0-alpha
- [ ] Basic input validation implementation
- [ ] Error message sanitization
- [ ] Security header helpers

### Version 0.3.0-alpha
- [ ] CSRF protection implementation
- [ ] Rate limiting framework
- [ ] Content validation system

### Version 1.0.0 (Production)
- [ ] Complete security audit
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Security documentation
- [ ] Vulnerability disclosure program

## Security-Related Configuration

Currently, security configuration is limited. Future versions will include:

```typescript
// PLANNED - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
const client = fluxhttp.create({
  security: {
    csrf: true,
    rateLimit: { requests: 100, window: 60000 },
    validateContent: true,
    secureHeaders: true
  }
});
```

## Disclaimer

This security policy applies to alpha software that is:
- Under active development
- Not suitable for production use
- Subject to significant changes
- Provided "as is" without security warranties

For production applications, please use established, audited HTTP client libraries.
